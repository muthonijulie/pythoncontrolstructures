Create a simple ATM program that allows a user to perform basic banking operations such as checking balance, depositing money, and withdrawing money. The program should use control structures to handle user input, perform the operations, and make decisions.


Instructions:


1. Initialize a variable to store the user's balance (e.g., starting with Ksh.1000).

2. Use a loop to repeatedly present the user with a menu of options:

   - Check balance

   - Deposit money

   - Withdraw money

   - Exit

3. Use `if-elif-else` statements to handle the user's menu choice:

   - If the user chooses to check the balance, display the current balance.

   - If the user chooses to deposit money, prompt for the amount to deposit and update the balance.

   - If the user chooses to withdraw money, prompt for the amount to withdraw and update the balance, ensuring the balance does not go negative.

   - If the user chooses to exit, terminate the loop and end the program.

4. Add comments to explain each part of the code.
